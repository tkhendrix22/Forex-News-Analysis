# Project Overview
This project is a fusion of machine learning and time series forecasting techniques aimed at predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of Forex news articles. By combining traditional machine learning models and the Facebook Prophet time series forecasting model, the project provides insights into how news impacts the foreign exchange market.

# Business Overview
Predicting the influence of Forex news articles is vital for traders and investors looking to forecast market movements driven by economic events. The project addresses this challenge by developing two predictive modelsâ€”one centered on machine learning and another leveraging time series forecasting. These models offer actionable insights to guide trading strategies.

# Data Analysis
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising Forex news articles and their associated attributes, including advanced metrics and economic indicators. Each column corresponds to a distinct economic indicator or event, along with the sentiment associated with the news. Spanning from 2010 to 2023, the dataset captures historical market trends and sentiment shifts. The data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saeedaghasoleimani/forex-fundumental-news-for-usd). 

### Columns Overview:
`Date`: Date of the news article

`ISM Manufacturing PMI`: Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index

`ISM Services PMI`: Institute for Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index

`Housing Starts`: Number of housing construction projects started

`Non-Farm Employment Change`: Change in the number of employed people

`Unemployment Rate`: Percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force

`Consumer Price Index (CPI)`: Measure of inflation

`Producer Price Index (PPI)`: Measure of average change in selling prices

`Retail Sales`: Total retail sales of consumer goods

# Exploratory Data Analysis
During the exploratory data analysis phase, historical trends in the sentiment of each economic indicator are uncovered. Over the period from 2010 to 2023, the analysis demonstrates that the market sentiment for most indicators has predominantly been positive. These insights underscore the importance of each economic indicator as significant news that influences market sentiment.
